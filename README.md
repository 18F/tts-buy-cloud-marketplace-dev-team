## Background
This procurement is to acquire labor to continue development of a cloud marketplace tool that is anticipated to allow government program offices to discover, obtain, and manage licenses for software-as-a-service (SaaS) products in an efficient and compliant manner.

Currently, the process for buying, managing, and distributing SaaS licenses is manual, decentralized, and unstandardized. As a result, agencies—and the program offices within them—are working in parallel to buy and use similar products. This approach lacks the benefit of collective action and is less transparent from an oversight perspective. Procurement and compliance obstacles may cause offices to settle for less-than-optimal products in order to get working more quickly. This tool with provide civil servants with the SaaS tools they need to stay current with evolving best practices.

The new tool will provide the ability to discover, obtain, and manage licenses for approved SaaS products, ideally from an already acquired inventory of licenses. Such a tool would improve transparency, and consequently, inventory management of SaaS licenses while enabling easier access to the tools necessary for program offices to deliver on their mission. This supports the mission of the TTS Office of Acquisition to make federal procurement a simpler, more enjoyable process.
