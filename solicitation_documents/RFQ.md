2.0 Administration
==================

Unless expressly authorized by the RFQ, any Quoter planning to take exception to a term or condition of the RFQ should consult with the Contracting Officer (CO) in writing before submitting a quotation.

The Quoters are advised to closely read the quote instructions outlined within section 8.0 Quotation Instructions before preparing a technical quotation.

3.0 Background
==============

This procurement is to acquire labor to continue development of a cloud marketplace tool that is anticipated to allow government program offices to discover, obtain, and manage licenses for software-as-a-service (SaaS) products in an efficient and compliant manner.

Currently, the process for buying, managing, and distributing SaaS licenses is manual, decentralized, and unstandardized. As a result, agencies—and the program offices within them—are working in parallel to buy and use similar products. This approach lacks the benefit of collective action and is less transparent from an oversight perspective. Procurement and compliance obstacles may cause offices to settle for less-than-optimal products in order to get working more quickly. This tool with provide civil servants with the SaaS tools they need to stay current with evolving best practices.

The new tool will provide the ability to discover, obtain, and manage licenses for approved SaaS products, ideally from an already acquired inventory of licenses. Such a tool would improve transparency, and consequently, inventory management of SaaS licenses while enabling easier access to the tools necessary for program offices to deliver on their mission. This supports the mission of the TTS Office of Acquisition to make federal procurement a simpler, more enjoyable process.

4.0 Period of Performance
=========================

The Period of Performance (POP) consists of one (1) Base Period of three (3) months and three (3) Option Periods of three (3) months each. The POP is expected to begin within 10 calendar days after award - specifically, from the day a kickoff is held with the contractor.

5.0 Type of Contract
====================

Based on the nature of this requirement, the government intends to award a Labor-Hour (LH) task order.

6.0 Pricing Structure
=====================

The Quoter is required to submit a price for each CLIN listed in the Pricing Response Form linked to in Section 8.0.

7.0 Special Instructions
========================

1.  **Communications Before Award.** The Quoter shall direct all communications to the Contracting Officer.

2.  **Potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest Statement.** No task order award shall be made until any potential conflict of interest has been neutralized or mitigated to the satisfaction of the CO in accordance with Subpart FAR 9.5 [*Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest*](https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/html/Subpart%209_5.html#wp1078823). Acknowledgement of this statement is to be made within the [*RFQ Technical Response Form*](https://goo.gl/forms/4GbcEJ23tD275wPI2).

8.0 Quotation Instructions
==========================

Submissions in response to this solicitation shall include a response to the [*RFQ Technical Response Form*](https://goo.gl/forms/4GbcEJ23tD275wPI2) and the [*RFQ Pricing Response Form*](https://goo.gl/forms/sFVhP9pBdlLvgSc02). A quotation that fails to include both of the forms identified above will not be considered for award.

9.0 Performance Work Statement
==============================

The Technology Transformation Services Office of Acquisition seeks the continued development of a cloud marketplace tool (based on an existing [*initial prototype*](http://gsa.invisionapp.com/share/4RCD8OISB)) that will allow government program offices to discover, obtain, and manage licenses for SaaS products in an efficient and compliant manner. The new tool will improve transparency into SaaS license usage and provide program offices with better access to the tools necessary to deliver on their mission while providing more effective inventory management.
To help mitigate risk associated with our timeline, the system will be built following Agile development principles. Additionally, it will be built using open-source code, comprehensive documentation, human-centered design, and an extensible infrastructure.

A successful tool should allow users to view information, both general and government-specific, about SaaS products, as well as allow authorized users to request, allocate, manage, return, and revoke purchased SaaS licenses according to their user type. Commercial SaaS marketplaces—such as the [*Amazon AWS Marketplace*](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/) or the [*Microsoft Azure Marketplace*](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/)—may be a good indicator of some core functionality.
TTS has a need for contractor support services to assist with the continued development of a Minimally Viable Product (MVP) of the tool using a [*Wizard of Oz model*](https://grasshopperherder.com/concierge-vs-wizard-of-oz-test/). An [*initial prototype*](http://gsa.invisionapp.com/share/4RCD8OISB) serves as a starting point for development, though the end result should be informed by usability research and testing as the tool is developed.

9.1 Tasks
---------

The contractor will provide the following services:

-   Contractor shall develop a web-based, interactive system allowing users to view information about SaaS products and authorized users to request, allocate, manage, return, and revoke purchased SaaS licenses.

-   Contractor shall conduct research activities, including stakeholder interviews and usability tests. Contractor shall create and deliver records and notes collected during their research.

-   Contractor shall work with TTS to ensure that the system is compliant with security policies.

-   Contractor shall ensure that the system includes user authentication and authorization functionality that uses open source encryption protocols.

-   Contractor shall post all code to a publicly-available code repository, with a Public Domain license.

-   Contractor shall ensure that the architecture is extensible to allow for further development, including integration with compatible internal or external systems (for example, integration with an instance of ServiceNow or Salesforce via an API).

-   Contractor shall incorporate analytics, monitoring, continuous integration, and measurement tools into their code base.

-   Contractor shall use plain language in application design and development whenever possible. In the event that TTS does not provide the Contractor with content-specific guidance or grammatical rules for the cloud marketplace tool, Contractor should adhere to [*18F’s content guide*](https://content-guide.18f.gov/).

-   Contractor shall utilize the [*U.S. Web Design Standards*](https://standards.usa.gov/) or other development standards as developed by the 18F team.

-   Contractor and TTS shall conduct work in two-week sprints and review completed work at the end of each sprint for acceptability before moving on. The contractor and government may mutually agree to alter sprint length as needed.

The contractor will **not** be responsible to perform the following:

-   Hosting of the system.

-   Manage the granting of an authority to operate.

9.2 Application Constraints
---------------------------

11.0 Evaluation
===============

11.1 Basis for Award
--------------------

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules. This is not a FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, procurement. All submissions in response to this RFQ are considered quotations and not proposals or offers, even if labeled as such. The offerors will be required to agree to and be bound by all instructions, procedures and rules of this RFQ. The Government is not obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, solicit final revised quotations, or use other techniques associated with FAR part 15.3.

The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value principles, utilizing the trade-off process. Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose quotation provides the greatest overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical capabilities than with making awards at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make awards at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical value. Offerors will be advised that the technical evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price.

1.  Evaluation Process. The Government intends to utilize a phased approach for this procurement as described below. To be considered for award, offerors must successfully pass through each phase.
    > Phase 1: Technical Evaluation and Oral Interview - The Government will evaluate the offeror’s performance or capability acceptability based on the following non-price technical factors which are of equal importance to each other:

-   Technical Understanding and Approach: The Government will evaluate the offeror’s technical approach: level of knowledge, technical expertise, and overall understanding of the requirement. The Government will also evaluate the offeror’s skills with open source software development, human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods.

-   Staffing Plan: The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed staffing methodology and skill levels/labor categories as well as the availability and relevant work experience demonstrated by Key Personnel.

-   Similar Experience: The Government will evaluate the offeror’s experience in performing projects of similar scope and complexity. The Government will also evaluate the offeror’s experience with open source software development, human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods.

1.  Phase 2: Pricing Schedule - Offeror’s Price as provided in the price quotation received via the Google Form will be reviewed separately from the technical evaluation.

11.2 Technical Evaluation Factors
---------------------------------

The following will be used to evaluate technical quotes:

### Technical Understanding and Approach.

The offeror shall succinctly describe level of knowledge, technical expertise and overall understanding of the requirement as set forth in the PWS, Section 9.0.

### Staffing Plan

The offeror shall submit a Staffing Plan which details the number of personnel by skill level/labor category needed to satisfy the objectives and requirements of the PWS. Key personnel should demonstrate their ability to be able to build software using the technical languages and frameworks outlined in section 9, developing software in the open, use of a strong user-centered product development approach, and their ability to work in using Scrum or another Agile framework.

All proposed skill levels/labor categories shall be consistent with your GSA Schedule.

1.  A breakdown of labor categories, including the title, number of personnel, and hours.

2.  A list of Key Personnel by name, title, contact information, proposed duties and roles, and resumes for each proposed Key Personnel in accordance with Personnel section of the PWS, Section 10. Resumes should include a description of the experience and capability for all Key Personnel proposed for the offeror’s project team. Resumes should also address the individual’s technical background, education, work experience, and accomplishments related to the activities described in the PWS, section 9.The proposal of any key personnel not currently employed by the offeror or teaming partners shall be accompanied by letters of intent signed by proposed Key Personnel in accordance with the PWS.

### Similar Experience

The offeror shall provide two examples of open source, web-based data platforms in accordance with the PWS. The project must have been delivered by either a) the offeror itself or b) a subcontractor that is proposed in response to this RFQ, not a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliated company.

At a minimum, provide:

1.  Recent and similar technical scope is past experience with building usable, responsive, consumer-facing website built within the past three (3) years.

2.  The summary shall include links to the public Git repository that includes the source code that was developed and accepted for the project. Actual access to a publicly available Git repository, an anonymized fork of a private repository, or an anonymized fork of a repository with Personally Identifiable Information/sensitive information is strongly encouraged over screenshots of private repositories. The summary should also include live links of the final product or current staging environment. If live links are not available, screenshots can be provided, along with a brief explanation as to why the project is no longer live. The projects should be recent and similar to the size and technical scope of this requirement.

11.3 Price Evaluation
---------------------

Each offeror’s price quotation will be evaluated separately from the technical quotation and oral interview. Proposed prices shall be evaluated for reasonableness and consistency with industry standards. Note that as submissions become more technically equal in their merit, the total evaluated price becomes more important. Therefore, it is critical that the offeror submit their best quotation initially.

Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

11.4 Oral Presentations Agenda
------------------------------

| **No.** | **AGENDA ITEM**                                | **MAXIMUM TIME**        |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1       | Introductions                                  | Approximately 5 minutes |
| 2       | Open Technical Session                         | 40 minutes              |
| 3       | Closing Remarks and Frequently Asked Questions | 5 minutes               |

### Rules

No part of these oral presentations constitutes a procedure in FAR Part 15. For this reason, the Government is not obligated to and does not intend to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, and proposal revisions are not requested and will not be allowed.
The oral presentation consists of an unstructured question and answer session on technical factors. The entire oral presentation will take place remotely via video chat and/or teleconference.
Offerors will not be able to use or present slides, graphs, charts or any other written presentation materials, including handouts.

### Content

During the Open Technical Session, the offeror will respond to Government’s questions related to the technical aspects of the offeror’s proposal.
Introductions will be used solely for introducing team member’s names and roles on both the Government and vendor teams. Time for introductions will not be allocated to business development purposes.

Although the technical factors are identified in the RFQ, the core questions are not listed there. Offerors must be prepared to answer questions about the technical aspects of their respective quotes. The goal of these presentations is to assess the technical abilities of the proposed Key Personnel and further elaborate on their proposed Technical approach to accomplish the objectives of this task.
This part of the oral presentations will not exceed 40 minutes. The Contracting Officer will strictly enforce this time limit on all presentations. There will be no follow-up session for further questions after this part of the presentation.
The session will conclude with closing remarks and responses to frequently asked questions for offerors.

### Presentation Location

Oral Presentations will take place via video chat, though audio may be substituted as needed. The Government will coordinate and set up the meeting space accordingly (providing dial-in information or links using a tool such as Zoom or Appear.in).

### Presentation Date and Time

The Government will schedule the date and time of the oral presentations with each offeror after the solicitation closing date and receiving each offeror’s quote submission. The Government reserves the right to reschedule any offeror’s oral presentations date at the discretion of the contracting officer.

### Presentation Participants

**Proposed Key Personnel must participate in the oral presentation. Otherwise, the offeror will be considered non-responsive and excluded from further consideration.**
Offerors may include as many participants as are necessary. Offerors should note that the Government will be asking technical questions during the oral presentation, so non-technical personnel may not need to attend.
After the presentations, vendors must email the meeting organizers the names of everyone who attended.
